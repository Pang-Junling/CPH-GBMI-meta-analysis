#This command will take a little longer to run, because it requires each input
#file to be examined twice. The METAL heterogeneity analysis requires a second
#pass of analysis to decide whether observed effect sizes (or test statistics)
#are homogeneous across samples. The resulting heterogeneity statistic has n-1
#degrees of freedom for n samples.
